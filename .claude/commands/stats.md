description: Display current portfolio statistics using the CLI stats tool
---

Run the portfolio analytics CLI and display the current statistics:

```bash
go run cmd/stats/main.go
```

Show me the output and summarize any key changes or risk metrics that need attention.

After displaying the stats, update the "Current Portfolio Statistics" section in CLAUDE.md with the latest data from the CLI output to keep the project documentation current.
